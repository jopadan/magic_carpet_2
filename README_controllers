    Gamepads and joysticks

  the 'gamepad' group inside the config.ini file can be used to define how gamepad controls are picked up by the game.
three different joysticks (each with two axes), two hats and six buttons can be configured using the keywords shown below.
  based on user preference and device limitations, the menu navigation can share axes/hat with the camera angle (axis_yaw/pitch) or the movement controls (axis_long/trans, hat_mov).
  the integer value expected is either '1'+ for enabled items or '0' for disabled ones.
 

possible keywords:
[gamepad]
axis_yaw = 0 ; roll and yaw axis (initiates turns during flight)
axis_yaw_inv = false ; false - no inversion needed, true - axis values need inversion
axis_pitch = 0 ; pitch (moves camera up/down during flight)
axis_pitch_inv = false
axis_long = 0 ; longitudinal movement (aka forward / back)
axis_long_inv = false
axis_trans = 0 ; transversal movement (aka strafe left/right)
axis_trans_inv = false
axis_nav_ns = 0 ; menu navigation North / South
axis_nav_ns_inv = false
axis_nav_ew = 0 ; menu navigation East / West
axis_nav_ew_inv = false
axis_fire_R = 0 ; fire right-hand spell, also right mouse button equivalent (right trigger)
axis_fire_L = 0 ; fire left-hand spell, also left mouse button equivalent (left trigger)
hat_nav = 0 ; menu navigation North / South / East / West
hat_nav_inv = false ; invert vertical axis
hat_mov = 0 ; longitudinal and transversal movement
hat_mov_inv = false ; invert vertical axis
button_spell = 0 ; joystick button-press code used for displaying the spellbook
button_minimap = 0 ; half-screen minimap
button_fire_R = 0 ; fire right-hand spell, also right mouse button equivalent
button_fire_L = 0 ; fire left-hand spell, also left mouse button equivalent
button_fwd = 0 ; joystick button-press code used for forward movement
button_back = 0 ; joystick button-press code used for backward movement
button_esc = 0 ; escape key equivalent
axis_dead_zone = 2048 ; increase if _mouse_ is unresponsive
trigger_dead_zone = 2048 ; trigger button-related dead zone
haptic_enabled = 0 ; set to 1 to try initialization of the controller's haptic engine
haptic_max_gain = 75 ; set GAIN value, if feature is supported. it limits the amplitude of all the effects between 0-100


    Sample setups

XBOX controllers:

[gamepad]
axis_yaw = 4 ; roll and yaw - horizontal axis on the right joystick
axis_pitch = 5 ; pitch - vertical axis on the right joystick
axis_long = 2 ; longitudinal movement - vertical axis on the left joystick
axis_long_inv = true ; needs inversion
axis_trans = 1 ; transversal movement - horizontal axis on the left joystick
button_minimap = 1 ; half-screen minimap - (A) button
button_spell = 3 ; spellbook - (X) button
button_esc = 4 ; escape key equivalent - (Y) button
button_fire_L = 2 ; a secondary MLB equivalent for menu interaction - (B) button
axis_dead_zone = 3000 ; joysticks are quite noisy and can get bumped accidentally so definitely at least 3000
trigger_dead_zone = 3000 ; trigger button-related dead zone
; select either hat or joystick control below:
;   menu navigation using the hat
;hat_nav = 1 ; menu navigation on the hat
;hat_nav_inv = true ; needs inversion on the vertical axis
;   menu navigation using the left joystick:
axis_nav_ns = 2 ; menu navigation North / South
axis_nav_ns_inv = true
axis_nav_ew = 1 ; menu navigation East / West
axis_nav_ew_inv = false
; select either buttons or triggers for firing
;   use buttons to fire
;button_fire_R = 6 ; fire right-hand spell - right button
;button_fire_L = 5 ; fire left-hand spell - left button
;   use triggers to fire
axis_fire_R = 6 ; fire right-hand spell - right trigger
axis_fire_L = 3 ; fire left-hand spell - left trigger
haptic_enabled = 1 ; set to 1 to try initialization of the controller's haptic engine
haptic_max_gain = 90 ; set GAIN value, if feature is supported. it limits the amplitude of all the effects between 0-100
